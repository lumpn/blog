## TPE Airport
When you arrive at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TPE), do these three things before you head over to your accommodation:
1. Take out some [local currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Taiwan_dollar). Any ATM will do.
2. Buy an [EasyCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyCard) at any convenience store.
3. Buy a tourist SIM card for mobile data.

## EasyCard
Buy an [EasyCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyCard) at any convenience store in the airport. You can use the EasyCard to pay for almost anything. Use it on the metro, bus, or bike in Taiwan. Use it for entrance fees at museums and to pay at almost any shop as well as many restaurants. So put at least 1000 [TWD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Taiwan_dollar) on it. You can top up the card at any metro station and at the counter of any convenience store.

## SIM card
You also want to grab a tourist SIM card for mobile data. You can get them at the airport as well. [ChungHwa Telecom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunghwa_Telecom) and [TaiwanMobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Mobile) are the networks with the best coverage. You'll find stores of both providers inside the airport. The SIM will cost you around 500 NTD for a 7 day pass with unlimited 4G data.

## Airport Metro
Once you've got all that, head down to the basement of the terminal where you'll find the [Taoyuan Airport MRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoyuan_Airport_MRT) metro to Taipei. There are two platforms, make sure you're on the one to Taipei. On that platform there are two types of trains, Commuter and Express. You want Express. They cost the same, Express just gets you to the city faster, even if you have to wait it. Every other train is Express.

## Taipei
Don't worry if you've missed something and you're already in the city. You can also get cash, EasyCards, tourist SIM cards here. It'll just be more walking. Cash is easy. You'll find ATMs at every bank and virtually every convenience store. The convenience store will sell you an EasyCard as well. For the tourist SIM card you'll have to find a ChungHwa Telecom or TaiwanMobile store. Make sure to bring your passport!
