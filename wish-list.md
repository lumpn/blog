# Wish list

Things, apps, and frameworks I wish existed but don't.

## Leaderboards

[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) has excellent leaderboards. Instead of throwing everyone into the same global leaderboard, users are [clustered into leagues](https://happilyevertravels.com/duolingo-leagues-explained/) and move up/down depending on how well they were doing that week. The entire system is designed to reward practicing more. Progress is a lot more tangible and therefore more engaging than on a global leaderboard.

[StarCraft II](https://starcraft2.com) has a very similar system with fewer leagues and bigger divisions. However, [scoring is based on MMR](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Battle.net_Leagues) and the entire system is designed to maximize fair matchmaking.

I wish there was a cloud service and app with an API for league based leaderboards. Not just the storage, also the roll-ups, and the visualization.

## Histograms

[Histograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) are great for visualizing distributions, however the results are highly dependent on the size of the bins. Instead of fixed size bins I wish [quantile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile) based bins would be the norm.

## Node editor

There are countless node graph editors and none of them are great. For over 30 years the gold standard for automatic layout has been and still is [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/). I wish there was a way to move nodes around manually while still retaining reasonable a layout.
