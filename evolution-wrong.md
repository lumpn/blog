# Evolution is wrong
`2024-01-24`

TL;DR: evolution is just flood fill, but you're not giving flood fill enough credit.

## Survival of the fittest

[Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism) is a theory of biological evolution, stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.

It is the survival of the fittest. A fierce competition for the crown. Evolution is an [optimization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) and its objective is to finds the best of the best. And by that we mean us. Humans. We're the best. ü•≥

Survival of the fittest is great because we're winning. Except, what about birds?  They also survived. Are they also... the fittest?


## Natural selection

Okay, so we have to be a little bit more specific and define fitness to mean "better designed for an immediate, local environment", nowadays commonly called an [ecological niche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche). How many niches are there? Well, there are currently about [10 million species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity) on our planet. If all of them are the fittest then there are at least 10 million niches.

Fine, so evolution is a [multi-objective optimization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization) with 10 million objectives and it finds the bests of the bests. And by that we mean us. And everything else. üôÇ

Except, what about dinosaurs? They survived for millions of years. They were the fittest. At least until [Chicxulub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event).


## Ecology

Okay, so we have to be a little bit more specific and define environment to mean whatever is around at that moment in time. We also have to factor in that our species are affecting the environment for other species, leading to [multi-species coevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coevolution), biome formation, and all of ecology. On our planet, evolution has produced over 5 billion species total, each of them the fittest at their point in time and space. Virtually all of them are extinct by now. Survival of the... uhm.

Fine, so evolution is an optimization algorithm and its objective is... something? It's complicated. üòê

Although, remember humans? We're complex and clever and awesome. Evolution produced us, so it must be doing something smart.

## Complexity

Okay, so how about this: evolution is optimizing for increase in complexity. Look at the [tree of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology), We're clearly seeing an increase in complexity at every level, so evolution has to be searching for that, right? It can't just be randomly changing DNA and seeing what sticks, right? It can't just be an exhaustive search like [flood fill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology)). Flood fill could never produce complexity. Flood fill just does...

| Evolution            | Flood fill     |
|----------------------|----------------|
| DNA                  | node           |
| population           | open set       |
| mutation / crossover | neighbor set   |
| selection            | permissibility |

Oh no.
