## Why Github?

I've maintained my own webserver hosting my own website and blog for 20 years now. Things kept breaking. Software was never meant for that kind of time frame. I want my articles to be available for at least another 20 years. Github will probably break as well, but at least it will be trivial to clone the repository.
